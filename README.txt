CS 162 - Assignment 4

Description: Hunt the Wumpus game written in C++ for a class project. Compile with included makefile.

Note: controltest.cpp and maptest.cpp exist for testing purposes and are not compiled with the rest of
program. These were created solely for me to experiment with different methods of implementing certain
features before I settled on the iterations I included in the final build.
